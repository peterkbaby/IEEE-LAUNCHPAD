#### Leadership and Influence:

> During the academics phase, from 2019 - 2023, there is no other community or student organisation I've part of in my campus. I've engaged in various voluntary leadership positions in and out my college. Including technical and non-technical organisations.
>
> The experiences I've gained from the activities and events I've been part of surely helped me to prepare myself to be a person who can manage, guide, and lead such a group of team. Telling about influencing others, I've been mentored and taught about 500+ students [Maybe more] in various fields including, community managing, technical and non-technical sessions & workshops, discussions, etc. I hope I've succeed in creating such a space for others to figure out what's the point of doing all this activities.
>
> Furthermore, I'm still volunteering with few organisation in order to share my knowledge, expertise, and guidance for fullfilling the vision and mission of such organisations.

#### Networking:
> Community Networking and Engagements are crucial in building the health atmosphere to grow and explore. Everyone is influenced by one another. To grow exponentially, such community spaces are necessary. The time I've anchored and managed a community meetup, I came to understand that I've a potential in engaging and dealing with people just in a matter of time. Listening, Understanding, Acknowledging each other can drastically helps in placing a healthy bonding with anyone.
>
> There are various communities and organisations, which are offering free and paid memberships, even after stepping out of college / academics. Working closely with the team of like minded gradually improve the skillsets in networking and community engagements. Letting others know about the oppurtunities and possibilities that these communities offer, and bringing the needy person to such open events can helps them in understanding the effect and impact of in-person experiences.

#### Career Plan:
> - Finding out the true potential that I can achieve & acquire : within the next year.
> - Explore more on Product Design, Development, Scale, and Manage.
> - Helps in growing the organisations I'm part of, there by letting more people to the eco system.



#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

> - Kerala Startup Ecosystem was opened various possibilities to the people around. It's lot easier than reaching out to seek help and guidance than before. Now people are started to build themselves, rather than primarily focuses on jobs on MNCs.
> - By the next years to come, we can consider a steady growth in formations of startups. The boom in accessibility to education, knowledge, infrastructure, and mainly access to freebies from various startup initiatives are pillars for this results.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:
> - I've participated in various Hackoberfest activities. But couldn't contribute with higher impact.
> - Other than those, I've made a few contributions. Most of them are restricted to personal and side project. I wish to try various open source contributions in the future.
