### About Me

Hey there! I'm Akhila, a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student passionate about leveraging technology to create meaningful solutions. With a robust foundation in Python, Java, and C, I thrive in the dynamic world of programming, constantly exploring new avenues for innovation.

As a Placement Coordinator in my college, I honed my communication and organizational skills, connecting fellow students with career opportunities and facilitating their professional growth. This role not only taught me the importance of networking but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for teamwork and collaboration.

Beyond academics, I've played a pivotal role in coordinating a university-level tech fest, where I helped create a platform for students to showcase their talents and exchange ideas. This experience fueled my passion for community building and fostering an environment where creativity flourishes.

Whether it's diving into complex algorithms or brainstorming innovative project ideas, I'm always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of technology. With a blend of technical expertise and leadership skills, I aspire to make a meaningful impact in the ever-evolving field of computer science.

|_Identity Recognition Using Brain Waves _                                          |Person identification technology recognizes individuals by exploiting their unique, measurable physiological and behavioralcharacteristics. However, the state-of-the-art person identification systems have been shown to be vulnerable, e.g., antisurveillance prosthetic masks can thwart face recognition, contact lenses can trick iris recognition, vocoder can compromisevoice identification and fingerprint films can deceive fingerprint sensors. EEG (Electroencephalography)-based identificationwhich utilizes the userâ€™s brainwave signals for identification and offers a more resilient solution, draw a lot of attention recently. However, the accuracy still requires improvement and very little work is focusing on the robustness and adaptabilityof the identification system. We propose MindID, an EEG-based biometric identification approach, achieveshigher accuracyand better characteristics. At first, the EEG data patterns are analyzed and the results show that the Delta pattern containsthe most distinctive information for user identification.           |   
| Breast Cancer Detection | this project aimed to use advanced technology, collaboration with medical experts, and a patient-centered approach to improve the early detection of breast cancer in girls with early menarche. Its key features include personalized risk assessment, user-friendly interfaces, educational materials, and compatibility with existing healthcare systems.                                             |   |         |
