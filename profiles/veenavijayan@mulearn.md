| ADVANCED GESTURE CONTROLLED SMART HOME  | A Smart Home System gives access to the controllable household appliances and may help render the electricity supply in a household, controlling use and along these lines lessening utilization. It has also proven to be an incredible advantage for the elderly and disabled. A form of home automation systems called assistive domestics provides an extensive feature range that can help the ones with particular accessibility concerns in their homes. These technology systems and assisting equipment have emerged as a viable option for the needy, who would rather stay in their homes than move to assisted living facilities. This paper presents a glove based home automation system which recognizes gestures and hence provides automated device control. Household devices can be controlled with simple gestures made while wearing the glove. A mobile application is also developed for the family members to keep track of the status and usage of devices. Hence, the system provides comfort to the specially-abled and simultaneously, it also keeps the caretakers informed.      |    |              |
| Computer Vision Based Visual Assist | Machine learning and IOT are growing in a rapid manner nowadays. This project is one such project based on machine learning: an object recognizer which is capable of recognizing objects and giving voice output. The total project is having a Raspberry pi processer board, an ESP Cam, a Node MCU Microcontroller board, Servo Motor, Ultrasonic Sensor etc. The ESP Cam captures the image of the object in front of it to the processor board. The processor processes the image signal into machine code and sends it to the Microcontroller. The microcontroller which is capable of WiFi access sends the signal to the web server. The output can be fetched as voice on mobile app.                                      |  |          |
