### About Me

> I'm a Data Science enthusiast with a strong foundation in statistics, mathematics, and programming. I have recently completed a post graduate degree in Data Science and AI.I am eager to apply my skills in a real-world setting. I am proficient in Python, R, and SQL, and have experience working with data visualization tools such as Tableau and PowerBI. I have a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms and have experience implementing them using popular libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow. I am also familiar with big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. I am excited to start my career in data science and contribute to solving complex problems using data-driven solutions.

| **Crop-Disease-Prediction**        | Crop disease prediction is a crucial application of deep learning in the field of agriculture. With the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep learning models, it is possible to achieve high accuracy rates in detecting and classifying crop diseases. By analyzing images of plant leaves, these models can identify early signs of diseases and help farmers take preventive measures.                                                 | [Hosted Link 1] |[github repo link](https://github.com/gtech-mulearn/LAUNCHPAD)   |
| **Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction**        | The Food Delivery Time Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the time it takes for a food delivery to be completed. The dataset used for this project includes various features such as delivery person age, delivery person ratings, distance, type of order, type of vehicle, and time taken for delivery.    | [Hosted Link 2]     | [github repo link](https://github.com/gtech-mulearn/LAUNCHPAD) |
