# Pavin Raj

### About Me

I'm Pavin Raj, a final year MCA student at Nirmala College, Muvattupuzha, and a part-time freelance web developer. Building useful software applications is my life's passion.

I've experimented with various programming languages and frameworks. I'm proficient in technologies such as PHP, Laravel, MySQL, AWS, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Apart from my personal projects, my expertise is also evident in the projects I've built as a freelance web developer.

I've maintained good academic performance throughout my studies and have completed online courses on Rest APIs, Real-time Communication for Web Apps, and PHP. At my college, I have contributed as an event coordinator, volunteering for events such as IT Fest and Arts Fest.

As academics are just the tip of the iceberg, I am eager to translate theory into practical IT solutions and contribute to an organization's success.
