Interactive elements allow users to engage with the hologram, deepening understanding. By combining holography with the allure of the Ghost Pepper, this project offers a fresh approach to storytelling and education. Exhibitions and digital platforms aim to captivate diverse audiences, igniting curiosity at the intersection of food, science, and innovation.                                             |  |  |
| Book reading robot |Automation and Artificial Intelligence have revolutionized traditional manual platforms, rendering products and services more accessible and cost-effective. Our project embodies this transformative ethos by offering assistance to individuals in reading books, serving as a valuable aid for both disabled and visually impaired individuals in story consumption and academic pursuits. Central to the project's architecture are key components including a microcontroller, image processor, camera, speaker module, and servo mechanism. The camera captures book pages as image files, which are then processed by the image processor to convert them into text. Subsequently, the text is transformed into voice output through the speaker module. Upon completion of each page, the processor signals the controller to activate the servo mechanism, facilitating seamless page-turning functionality. |  |  |
