#### Networking:

- Solving doubts of others and helping them with various issues is one of my favorite hobbies as it rewards me with extra knowledge. I have always helped and will keep helping those in need as far as I can.

#### Career Plan:

- Currently I am working on my skills to hone them to create better projects and to get real world industry exposure. For that I am actively looking for internship or fresher openings also.
- I want to learn more about web development and dive deep into the various processes that happen in the backend. For that I like to start with the popular tech stack MERN and then with enough experience transition into tools used for maintaining large companies like the Java Spring framework.
- Along with this I also want to learn more about the linux environment to create my own flavor of linux and also create an andorid os if I could elevate my skills to that high level,

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala have a bright future in the Technology field and I am all in for it.
- New startups and other industries will surely take the technology as well as other fields to the next level and I wish to become a part of it by making my own contributions.
- My one honest request is to completely change the current educational syllabus and make available more job ready skill course to the young generation at the earliest so as to boost the economy and to create a better society

#### Competitive Website Profiles:

- Used to do lots of labs in [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/p/WhitehatAbhi)
