#### Leadership and Influence:

- I didn't have much experience as a leader or influencer in this domain of web development. However, when I was working as a QA in an software product based company I had opportunity to lead my team towards a common goal. I believe I have great leadership quality and influene my team members to strengthen their skills and motivate them as well.

#### Networking:

- As of now my network is too small and I am still working on how to increase it. Joining mulearn is also a part of it. If I get a chance to connect with others with the same quality or interest like me, I will not miss the chance to connect with them.  

#### Career Plan:

- I have both immediate and long term career plan for my future. Learning and practicing my skills using free online resources until I get an opportunity to showcase my skills in a company to earn and become financially stable. On the other hand long term plans are little different, that is, complete masters education in computer science by specialising in any emerging technologies like AI / ML / DL / DS etc and do research & development after getting doctorate in the field. Moreover, starting a product based IT company in my neighbourhood for development of my society and people also a dream. I think after 10-15 years, I can achieve these goals and dreams. I know my dream is crazy but I will definitely reach that mark.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- My knowledge about Kerala's Tech ecosystem is limited. However I know many communities and tech enthusiasts are emerging everyday in kerala and working towards a common goal of building a strong tech culture in Kerala. I am very thrilled to make contributions towards it. I hope in near future Kerala will become a major IT hub in India.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- As of today, I didn't contributed or get a chance to contribute to any open source projects. Reason was I didn't tried it yet, and I believe, my skill should be improved before doing it. 


#### Competitive Website Profiles:
