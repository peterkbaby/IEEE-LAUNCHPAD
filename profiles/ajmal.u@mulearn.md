| **Youtube Adview using Machine Learning**  | Youtube advertisers pay content creators based on adviews and clicks for the goods and services being marketed. They want to estimate the adview based on other metrics like comments, likes etc. The problem statement is therefore to train various regression models and choose the best one to predict the number of adviews. The data needs to be refined and cleaned before feeding in the algorithms for better results.                                              |
