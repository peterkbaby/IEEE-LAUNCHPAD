# JOHAN GEROGE

### About Me

> I'm Johan George, a 20-year-old with a double dose of passion: web development and music, especially the world of front-end development.  Code and creativity go hand-in-hand for me! Whether I'm building something new online or jamming on my [Instrument], I'm always pushing the boundaries and exploring what's possible.

My ultimate goal is to delve deeper into the world of computer careers and find the perfect fit where I can combine my love for web development with other creative fields.  My curiosity is relentless, and I'm always on the lookout for new things to learn.

One of my biggest strengths is my ability to push myself outside my comfort zone. I might not always get it right on the first try, but I'm never afraid to learn from my mistakes and keep growing.
