### About Me

> Hi! I'm a final year BTech student studying Computer Science. I love coding and problem-solving, especially in languages like C and Python. I've also dabbled in web stuff like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I'm still learning, I've already done some cool projects in college. As I finish up my studies, I'm excited to do more projects and learn even more.
