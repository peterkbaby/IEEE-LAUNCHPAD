|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **WSL2 FORENSICS**  | Explored the detection, acquisition, and postmortem analysis of WSL2 instances, including identifying WSL2 guests and automating the investigation process, challenges and considerations in incident handling and computer forensics related to integrating the Windows Subsystem for Linux, version 2 (WSL2), into Microsoft’s operating systems.                                              | 
| **MERN STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT**  | Developed a single‑page web application utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and essential web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project encompasses the creation of a user‑friendly Sign‑up and Login Page, ensuring secure authentication processes. Additionally, implemented an Issue Tracker functionality within the application, enabling seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficient issue management.                                             |
| **AI for Cybersecurity**  | Semantic Analysis and Classification of emails through informative selection of features and ensemble AI model.                          |
| **A NOVEL HYBRID ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUE FOR DATABASE**  | The approach integrates substitution and transposition methods for enhanced data protection. This solution contributes to a more secure data encryption process, combining the strengths of substitution and transposition methodologies.|

#### Leadership and Influence:

- **Core Member, Social Engagement Centre**: As a part of my active social volunteering, I have demonstrated leadership by organizing and executing diverse camps and events for societal
betterment

#### Networking:

- As a core member of the placement cell, I had enough opportunities to interact and connect with various industrialists.
- I often participate in GDSC, Google Cloud and other common meet-ups.
- Member of G-Tech Mulearn Discord Server from Early 2022. 

#### Career Plan:

- My immediate career plan is to get into an entry-level position in an industrial setting where I can apply the theoretical knowledge that I have gained over my academics. Later, as the career progresses, after 2-3 years, I want to be at a mid-senior level, and later, I would like to see myself in a leadership position where I could mentor new graduates who follow a similar or a better path I have come over.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has immense potential to excel in the technology startup ecosystem; it can be achieved by making the government policies lenient, Promoting STEM education, Industrial and Academic collaboration, Promoting sustainable and Impactful ventures, and Promoting diversity in terms of gender and ethnicity, and background fosters creativity and innovation.
